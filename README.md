# Using-a-Pre-trained-Image-AI-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds

This project classifies pet images using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It compares the results to the actual pet label (extracted from the image filename) and summarizes how well the CNN performed on the classification task.

## Features

- Classifies pet images using one of several pretrained CNN architectures (`vgg`, `resnet`, `alexnet`)
- Compares model predictions with actual labels derived from image filenames
- Provides detailed statistics on classification accuracy, dog breed recognition, and more
- Supports custom datasets and dog breed lists

## Results

After running, the program prints a summary of:
- Total images, dog images, and non-dog images
- Percentage and count of correct matches, correct dog breed, and correct dog/not-dog classification
- (Optionally) Lists of incorrectly classified images

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python and TensorFlow Nanodegree.
